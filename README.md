# Bloomtech Interview Project
Hello! So this is a revamp of a project I did back in November as volunteer work at my current employer. I added API functionality to it so I can demonstrate knowledge in that area. You will notice a little Bloomtech icon on the page. 

A couple of things you’ll probably notice—

I have my results parameter to pull in up to 5000 records. I noticed when I didn’t do large numbers it limited the search results (makes sense as this is a random gen). 

Since I can pull in quite a few requests at times—the API errors out in order to free up bandwidth. Didn’t have a chance to create some sort of alert letting users know that this is why results are not being displayed. 

If no results are found the spinning loader will stop showing. I’ve found luck using really generic names like ‘Tim’,

You will notice a bug (literally) in the tic-tac-toe game. This project was an exercise I created for the Girl Scouts so they could review the code, find the bug, and correct it. 



# LIVE STEAM Event 2021

The Lenexa and Corporate offices at Terracon partnered with the Girl Scouts of NE Kansas and NW Missouri and Science City for an in-person LIVE STEAM event the evening of Friday November 5, 2021.  

More than 200 local Girl Scouts (4th and 5th grades) came together to explore the world of science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) through hands-on workshops.  

This event encourages young ladies to pursue careers in STEAM and is a wonderful opportunity for Terracon to partner with our community.

As an exercise we had the Girl Scouts work their way through the code for the game to find the "bug" (which is represented by a spider emoji) within the game.

I was going for a vintage look and decided on an older Windows operating system-- Windows 95 <a href="https://alexbsoft.github.io/win95.css/">using this custom Windows 95 bootstrap</a> by <a href = "https://alex-b.me/">Alex B</a>.
